# A greenhouse control system modeled with the Real-Time expansion of VDM++.
This is a University project for Modeling of Mission-Critical Systems, Aarhus University. It's based on the original "HomeAutomationRT" example project included in the Overture Tool.

# Setup
Launch Overture Tool (https://www.overturetool.org/) and set a new run configuration.

The run configuration's entry point is the World class, and the run() method.

Check the console for the output, and the generated folder for code coverage. In order to test the system with new scenarios, edit the scenario.txt file.
